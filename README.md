## Designing Icons
1. Find the original SVG icon and add it to the `icons/original` folder
2. Open the `icons/starter.svg` file in **Adobe Illustrator**
3. Scale the original icon down to the correct pixel dimensions `(32x32)`
4. Icon fonts can't be multicolored so choose the color best suited for the icon and apply it to the circle (ellipsis)
5. Center the icon on top of the ellipsis (`Horizontal Align Center` and `Vertical Align Center`) the icons on 6. Use the **Pathfinder** tool to cut out the shape from the circle (`Minus Front`)
7. Select all the paths you want to merge and exclude any internal paths you do not
8. Open your **Pathfinder** and click `Unite` to merge the objects
9. Go to top menu and click `Object` tab, in drop down choose `compound path` and click `make` or you press `ctrl+8`
10. When finished `Save As` to the `icons/color` folder and name the icon correctly (this name will be the name used in the css class)
