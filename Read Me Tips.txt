COMBINE PATHS - (COMPOUND PATHS FOR SVG ICONS!)
-------------------------------------------------
1. select all the paths you want to merge (exclude any internal paths you do not want to merge).

2. next open your Pathfinder panel and press Unite. This will merge the objects. 

3. then go to top menu and click Object tab, in drop down choose compound path and press make.


::: TIP :::

- press "ctrl+8" to quickly make compound path

- always import "selection.json" to icomoon and use settings

- always import new icons after they're ran through icomoon svg generator to "scavengerbot" set (don't import from the "color" icons folder)

- bump "package.json" version up once

- run "git push"

- run "npm publish"
